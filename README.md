#Point Tracking for D-3DGS
This project is built upon the Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting code from the Jonathon Luiten's Dynamic3DGaussians repository: https://github.com/JonathonLuiten/Dynamic3DGaussians.git
The goal was to implement point tracking for randomly selected points in the scene. Functions that serve in achieving this goal are in the train.py file, and the visualize.py file is altered to visualize the trajectories.
##Set-Up
To set up D-3DGS, the instructions on the original project page can be used with the altered files provided on this page. I have altered the environment.yml flle to the versions that work for me. 
If there are problems with set-up, you can also completely use the original files at first, and then copy the differentiated files from here.
